### Quiz Question 1 of 4
In the worst case how many comparison operations does the merge sort algorithm perform?
> O(n) linear

### Quiz Question 2 of 4
What is the space complexity of the merge sort algorithm?
> O(n) linear - even though each split step allocates n amount of space, 

> the steps don't occur simultaneously and at most only n amount of memory is needed

### Quiz Question 3 of 4
What is the overall runtime of the merge sort algorithm?
> O (n log n) qualilinear time.

### Quiz Question 4 of 4
List slicing increases the runtime of the merge sort algorithm because values have to be read sequentially and copied into a new array for each list slice
> True
