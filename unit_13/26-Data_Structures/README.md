# Python Techdegree: Data Structures
In computer science a data structure is a construct that allows us to organize and store data in our programs.

In this course we're going to learn about two introductory data structures - arrays and linked lists! We'll look at common operations and how the runtimes of these operations affect our everyday code.

For the rest of the course we're going to bring our knowledge of algorithms and data structures together to solve the problem of sorting data using the merge sort algorithm

In this course, we'll explore:

    * Arrays
    * Linked Lists
    * Merge Sort
    * Divide and Conquer
    * Recursion
