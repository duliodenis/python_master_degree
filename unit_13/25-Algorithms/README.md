# Python Techdegree: Algorithms
Algorithms are a fundamental topic in computer science, power many of the largest companies today and are used in making many decisions that affect our day to day lives - in obvious places like Google's PageRank algorithm to more obscure use cases like national security and local policing.

In this introductory course, we're going to take our first steps towards understanding the world of algorithms and data structures. Before we can study individual algorithms we're going to spend time learning how to evaluate algorithms, how to make comparisons and how to develop algorithmic thinking

In this course, we'll explore:

    * Algorithmic thinking
    * Time and space complexity
    * Big O notation
    * Linear and binary search
