### Quiz Question 1 of 5
My son throws toys all over the floor and I clean them up by picking up one at a time. How would you generalize the runtime of my "cleaning" algorithm?
> O(n) or Linear time

### Quiz Question 2 of 5
Every step in an algorithm has a cost or time complexity of its own
> True

### Quiz Question 3 of 5
I started following a workout plan recently and one of the routines goes like this - I have to do a certain number of pull-ups and for each pull-up that I complete, I have to complete an equivalent number of pushups. For example, if I want to do 10 pull-ups, after each pull-up, I do 10 pushups. How can you generalize the running time of such a routine?
> Quadratic time because the total number of exercises completed for any given routine is n times n

### Quiz Question 4 of 5
If an algorithm has a runtime of O(1) how much longer will it take when n = 10000 compared to when n = 10
> Same amount of time

### Quiz Question 5 of 5
Please fill in the correct answer in each blank provided below.
> The O in Big O stands for order of ___
> magnitude
