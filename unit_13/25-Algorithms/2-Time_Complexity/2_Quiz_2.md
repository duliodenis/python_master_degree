### Quiz Question 1 of 3
In general polynomial runtimes are considered to be more efficient than exponential runtimes
> True

### Quiz Question 2 of 3
If an algorithm has three steps, one that takes constant time, one that takes linear time and one that takes quadratic time, what is the overall runtime of the algorithm?
> Quadratic - O(n^2) - since it is the runtime with the largest cost and serves as an upper bound 

### Quiz Question 3 of 3
You have a box of Lego bricks of various colors that you want to organize into one pile ordered by color. You work with a friend and split the bricks into the smallest piles possible, organize each pile and combine piles as they are organized. How would you generally define the runtime of this algorithm as?
> Quasilinear - O(n log n) - First the pile is split into the smallest size possible, which would take log n operations, and then for each split we carry out n number of sorting operations
