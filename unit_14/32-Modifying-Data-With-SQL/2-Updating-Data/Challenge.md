### Challenge Task 1 of 2
We have an eCommerce database and it has a products table. It has the columns id, name, description and price.

The warehouse is closing down. There's a clearance sale and all products need to be priced 0.99.

> UPDATE products SET price = 0.99;

### Challenge Task 2 of 2
Now we're using a database from a smartphone. It has a phone_book table. It has the columns id, first_name, last_name and phone.

Update all contacts to have the first name of "Mystery" and last name of "Person".

> UPDATE phone_book SET first_name = "Mystery", last_name = "Person";
