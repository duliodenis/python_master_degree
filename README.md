# Python Master Degree
My self study of the Foundations of Python in order to build Mastery. 

This curriculum is structured into a Bachelor, Master, and Doctoral level tiers. The Bachelor tier is the four stage Treehouse Python Techdegree (Beginner, Intermediate, Flask, and Django with both course work and project work). 

Beyond the standard techdegree I've designed a two stage Master tier of data structures/algorithms and data science. Finally, the Doctoral tier is composed of Deep Learning, Machine Learning, AI and concluding with a thesis.

This repo contains twelve projects from the [Python Techdegree program](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/python-web-development) offered by Team Treehouse. The techdegree represents **350 hours** of Python Mastery broken down into 24 courses taking 190 hours and 12 projects taking and additional 160 hours. With an additional 20 courses of Data Structures/Algorithms, Data Science, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and culminating in the [Udacity Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd898) to top off to over 40 courses and 8 Workshops - a Doctoral Degree worth of Full Stack Python and AI culminating in participation in a Kaggle Competition.
